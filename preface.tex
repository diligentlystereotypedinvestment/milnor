\section{Preface and Guide to the Literature}

The name ``algebraic $K $-theory'' describes a branch of algebra which centers about two functors, $K_{0} $ and $K_{1} $, which assign to each associative ring $\Lambda $ an abelian group $K_{0}\Lambda $ or $K_{1}\Lambda $ respectively. The theory has been developed by many authors, but the work of Hyman Bass have been particularly noteworthy, and Bass's book \textit{Algebraic $K $-theory} \textcite{Bass1968AlgebraicK}, is the most important source of information. Here is a selected list of further reference:
